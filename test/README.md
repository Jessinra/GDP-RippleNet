# Test
This folder contains some latest experiments result (model evaluation) in form of jupyter notebook, named after the timestamp when the training conducted. 

Mapping between log, notebook, and training code example: 
- Timestamp : 1561003485.396884
- TESTING_CODE : `1561003485.396884`
- `/log` folder : `./1561003485.396884`
- `/test` Jupyter Notebook : `./Check training result 1561003485.396884.ipynb`

## How to check training result
1. Find the training result folder inside `../log` (find the latest), copy the folder name.
2. Create copy of latest jupyter notebook inside this folder.
3. Rename folder to match a folder in `../log` (for traceability purpose).
4. Replace `TESTING_CODE` at the top of the notebook.
5. Run the notebook
